            <p class="intro">Inventor Nikola Tesla contributed to the development of the alternating-current electrical
            system that's widely used today and discovered the rotating magnetic field (the basis of most 
            AC machinery).</p> 
            <h1>Nikola Tesla Biography</h1>
            <p>Nikola Tesla (July 10, 1856 to January 7, 1943) was an engineer known for designing the 
            alternating-current (AC) electric system, which is still the predominant electrical system
            used across the world today. He also created the "Tesla coil," which is still used in radio 
            technology. </p>
            <p>Born in modern-day Croatia, Tesla came to the United States in 1884 and briefly worked 
            with <span class="fame-name">Thomas Edison</span> before the two parted ways. He sold several patent rights, 
            including those to his AC machinery, to <span class="fame-name">George Westinghouse</span>.</p>

            <h1>Inventions</h1>
            <p>Throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed ideas for a number of important
            inventions — most of which were officially patented by other inventors — including dynamos (electrical
            generators similar to batteries) and the induction motor. </p>
            <p>He was also a pioneer in the discovery of radar technology, X-ray technology, remote control and the 
            rotating magnetic field — the basis of most AC machinery. Tesla is most well-known for his contributions 
            in AC electricity and for the Tesla coil.</p>
            <h3>AC Electrical System</h3>
            <p>Tesla designed the alternating-current (AC) electrical system, which would quickly become the preeminent 
            power system of the 20th century and has remained the worldwide standard ever since. In 1887, Tesla found 
            funding for his new Tesla Electric Company, and by the end of the year he had successfully filed several 
            patents for AC-based inventions.</p>
            <h3>Hydroelectric Power Plant</h3>
            <p>In 1895, Tesla designed what was among the first AC hydroelectric power plants in the United States, at 
            Niagara Falls.</p>
            <p>The following year, it was used to power the city of Buffalo, New York — a feat that was highly publicized 
            throughout the world and helped further AC electricity’s path to becoming the world’s power system.</p>
            <h3>Tesla Coil</h3>
            <p>In the late 19th century, Tesla patented the Tesla coil, which laid the foundation for wireless technologies 
            and is still used in radio technology today. The heart of an electrical circuit, the Tesla coil is an 
            inductor used in many early radio transmission antennas. </p>
